# Ethereum POWer Problem

So Ethereum currently uses a consensus mechanism (a method of agreement of transactions on the blockchain by its users)

called `Proof-Of-Work (POW)`. POW involves users of a blockchain using fast and heavy computers to figure out the solution

to a particular computational problem. These types of users are called `miners`. These machines in turn need a lot of energy

and power to run and consequently are really expensive to buy. So apart from the fact that they leave a huge carbon footprint

and consume a lot of energy globally, it is particularly difficult for a regular user to be part of the blockchain as a miner.


# Gas Fees Problem

Contrary to what you might have thought, Ethereum is slow, too slow. It makes about 10-15 transactions per second.

To put it in perspective, the centralized platform, Visa, makes 1700+ transactions per second. This means if you make a

transaction on both platforms, you're at least 113 times more likely to have your transaction processed in the same second

on Visa than Ethereum. This speed of Ethereum directly affects gas fees per transaction (how much ether you're charged to

make a transaction) on the blockchain, since `miners` will pick transactions that offer higher gas fees to include in the current

block. So if you want your transaction to be picked, processed and mined faster, you have to add more gas (pay more).


# POSolution

Another consensus mechanism was thought of some years ago as a replacement for POW. It is called `Proof-Of-Stake (POS).`

POS unlike POW, does not make use of miners as validators, rather, it uses stakers. Long story short, a group of people voluntarily

stake a minimum amount of ether (ETH) in order to validate the chain. This improves the speed of Ethereum and keeps the security

intact as you lose ETH if you wrongly validate. You can see that this eliminates the need for expensive mining computers and consequently

reduces the carbon footprint and energy consumption by a large margin. Good news for our environment I guess :)

POS is currently in the works and with the advent of The Merge (a plan for which POS is adopted into the ethereum blockchain)

in a few months, it will finally be the accepted as the consensus mechanism for Ethereum.


# Conclusion

As seen in the chart I posted minutes ago, energy consumption has risen exponentially since 2021 and is at an all-time high for Ethereum.

If `The Merge` is successful in some months, and ethereum developers and clients alike don't have software bugs, POS would be adopted

and this would significantly improve Ethereum speed and security, reduce gas fees, the carbon footprint and energy consumption.

My thought is that this "innovation" would push many investors to look into the Ethereum blockchain thereby increasing the market cap.

So its very possible ETH will financially hit an all-time high before the end of the year.
